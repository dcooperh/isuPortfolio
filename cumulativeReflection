In my time at Iowa State studying computer engineering I learned many things.  From top to bottom computers are very complex systems that can be broken into simple pieces, as a computer engineer I got the chance to learn aboul all of these pieces from hardware to software to networking and everything in between.  During this I'd say the most important thing I learned about was troubleshooting.  It is imperative in this field to know how to look at a problem and break it into smaller simpler pieces.  After all, it's just 1's and 0's.  This helped in the industry when I had a job as a systems engineer in Kansas City for a company called Netsmart.  There I was able to put what I've learned to good use orchestrating cloud support for electronic health records.  One of the most valuable things I learned between my experiences at school and work was about working with people.  It is certainly the aspect I enjoy the most.  I learned to work with all different kinds of people and to understand that everyone has brilliance to contribute.  Iowa State has been a breeding ground for success.  It is an honor and a privilege to have atteneded.
