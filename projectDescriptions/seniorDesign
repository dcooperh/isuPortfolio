Currently, wireless security courses here at Iowa State University utilize wired testing environments which 
generate “dummy” traffic so that students may observe and interact as if they are on a real network. This method 
is hard to scale, requires a great deal of equipment, and is also difficult to contain. Therefore, the proposed 
solution is for the creation of an isolated wireless facility for graduate coursework in wireless security. 

In order to isolate these networks, a Faraday cage must be created which encapsulates the equipment such that only 
authorized users can connect to it. Additionally, these networks would be secured from the campus network using a 
proxy server so that undesirable traffic would not escape into the wild, and outside traffic will not be visible in 
the cage. Another part of the project is to provide curriculum in the form of lab experiments which will be developed
to highlight the educational value of these isolated networks.

Within the Faraday cage, there is the desire to simulate a working mobile telephone network.  In order to do so
there would need to be a cell phone tower inside the small confined space of the cage.  This is accomplished by the
use of a software defined radio (SDR).  My contribution to this project is to equip the SDR with OpenBTS software to
create a working cell phone tower.  To do so I have done extensive research on both SDR's and the software that is used
enable them to operate.
