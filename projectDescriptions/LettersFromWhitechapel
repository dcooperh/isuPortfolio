Letters from Whitechapel is a cat and mouse style board game in which one player plays Jack the Ripper,
and his goal is to take five victims before being caught. The other players are police detectives who must
cooperate to catch Jack the Ripper before the end of the game. The game board represents the Whitechapel 
area at the time of Jack the Ripper and is marked with 199 numbered circles linked together by dotted lines.
During play, Jack the Ripper, the Policemen, and the Wretched are moved along the dotted lines that represent 
Whitechapel's streets. Jack the Ripper moves stealthily between numbered circles, while policemen move on their 
patrols between crossings, and the Wretched wander alone between the numbered circles.

The goal of this project was to develop a multiplayer web interface for playing this game.  It would have an
HTML and Javascript front end, powered by a Java servlet back end.  We had a group of 4 to complete the project.
My personal contribution was with the front end.  I designed the user interface with HTML and equipped it to
interact with the Java backend via Javascript.

We came together with a very user friendly application.  Due to our inexperience we were testing the front end 
relentlessly before pushing code.  We also had very effective communication between front-end and back-end.  Having 
multiple methods of communication, we became quite familiar with the task. This allowed us to connect things well 
to make a functioning dynamic user specific page for each player in a multiplayer game.

I learned a lot about the importance of application architecture and constant collaboration.  Some of the problems 
we encountered were due to the fact that we werenâ€™t always coding together.  But whenever we did we worked wonders.  
Overall, I learned the most about front end development.  I had no experience with web development prior to this project 
so I took away the most from learning HTML and Javascript from scratch.
