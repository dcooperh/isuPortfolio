This research project involved detailing and demonstrating a collision attack on the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.
Proper hashing is essential to modern day cybersecurity, as it is used to verify the integrity of stored and shared. In 
order for a hash algorithm to be considered safe to use for verification, it must not compute duplicating hashes for any
two documents given to it, unless they are copies of the same document. This means that there should not be two files that
are distinctly different that compute to the same hash using a hashing algorithm.  In February 2017, Google and CWI performed
the first ever practical collision attack on SHA-1.

My role in this project was to research the method in which the attack was performed.  This required to first understand
how SHA-1 works when used appropriately.  It is a hash algorithm which has 80 steps and uses a 160 bit key.  This translates
to the smallest of changes propogating massive alterations to the final computed hash.  This makes creating a collision very
intricate.  In order to manipulate this the attack targeted the format of a PDF with a JPEG image embedded inside.  This is
due to the very different visual presentation to very small encoding differences.  In the end the files ares are nearly identical
except for approximately 6 lines of hexdump values referred to as the collision blocks.  These create disturbance vectors within
the computation which take different paths to reach the same end result.
