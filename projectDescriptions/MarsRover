For embedded systems class, the final project was to program a roomba robot equipped with sensors and an FPGA to
be operatable remotely via Bluetooth.  The intended operation was to locate a small space indicated by four thin
pvc pipes within a larger rectanglular space.  In order to accomplish this, myself and 3 others developed a method in
which information about the surroundings of the robot were relayed to a command line on a remote computer.

My role in the project was the development of the algorithm we would use to find the finishing spot as well as to
calibrate and fine tune the sensors we would be using.  The sensors we were using were infrared and sonar.  In order to
program and calibrate these we needed to test out values returned by the sensor and compare them to the measurements.
The development of the algorithm involved coming up with a systematic way to scan obstacles regardless of the course and
find a way to the finish.

I learned a lot from this project.  First and foremost I learned the degree of care that must be placed when calibrating
sensors.  They were very finnicky and did not always work as intended.  When operating remotely, we were to place full
trust into our sensors so faulty programming would be detrimental to even the sturdiest of approaches to solving the
overall navigation problem.  I also learned a lot about effective and efficient groupwork.  Many long hours were spent
on this and it could have been many more if not for harmonious delegation and enthusiasm about the group.
